    <!-- Inserts `guify` into the global namespace, this must be done after the body exists, as the developer (https://jons.website/projects/guify/) says:
    Guify works by creating an HTML element (<div class="guify-container">) and making it the child of some element of your choice; you can specify this with the `root` key in the GUI constructor. If you don't specify a value for `root`, it defaults to `document.body`. Because your script loads it in the document `head`, I don't think the body exists yet as far as JS knows, so it's assigning a null value. You can fix this by loading the script that creates the GUI later in your document, perhaps at the end of `body` - or you can just add `defer` to do that for you, as in: -->
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src='../js/guify/lib/guify.js'></script>
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src="../js/p5/p5.js"></script>
    <script defer type="text/javascript" src="sketch.js"></script>
</head>

<!-- <body style="background-image: linear-gradient(red, yellow);"> -->

<body>
    <div id="drawing-area" style="width:100vw; height: 100vh;"></div>
</body>
