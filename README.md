# MakingMovementIrresistible

Making Movement Irresistible explores how a novel technology system could make the challenges of exercising with an aging body, within space limitations, enjoyable and thus targets specific health and wellbeing objectives. Working with a co-creation model, this pan-Wales project will be developed in collaboration with dance practitioners, Dawns i Bawb, and health professionals, led by Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board.
